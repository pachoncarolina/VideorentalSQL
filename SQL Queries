### Queries

In this sections I will display some of the queries I used to answer some of the business questions. 

*What are the sales per month?*
```
    SELECT EXTRACT (MONTH FROM payment_date) AS month_number, 						
    CASE WHEN (EXTRACT (MONTH FROM payment_date) = 2) THEN 'February'						
    WHEN (EXTRACT (MONTH FROM payment_date) = 3) THEN 'March'						
	  WHEN (EXTRACT (MONTH FROM payment_date) = 4) THEN 'April'					
	  ELSE 'May' END AS month_name,					
    SUM(amount)						
    FROM payment						
    GROUP BY month_number						
    ORDER BY month_number;						
```
